#Bike MD
Live site: bike-md.herokuapp.com
Bike MD is a community of motorcycle technicians, a place where they can connect with each other and ask technical questions, browse common problems and solutions by model, and help each other troubleshoot vehicles more efficiently. This was originally built as my final project for the Iron Yard. It was written in Python, Django, and JavaScript. Since then I have been making a list of improvements and
bugs that need to be addressed.
    TODO List:
    1. finish profile page.
    2. finish notifications.
    3. refactor JavaScript to remove repetitive functions, on clicks etc...
    4. refactor and clean up CSS.
    *many more to come
