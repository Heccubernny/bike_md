#Bike MD
Bike MD is a community of motorcycle technicians, a place where they can connect with each other and ask technical questions, browse common problems and solutions by model, and help each other troubleshoot vehicles more efficiently. This was my final project for the Iron Yard. It was built by a Python/JavaScript dev and two UI/UX developers over a two week period at The Iron Yard.
We have several more features to add and look forward to refining the design in the coming
weeks.
